excerpt: Slides from a presentation covering website security.
---

In an effort to learn more about web security and to teach others about it I ran a small workshop on the common security misconfigurations that can be found on websites.

Along with a small presentation on these misconfigurations and how to prevent against them being exploited, the workshop included an intentionally hackable website that I made, giving everyone a chance to exploit things like XSS, CSRF and SQL Injection.
