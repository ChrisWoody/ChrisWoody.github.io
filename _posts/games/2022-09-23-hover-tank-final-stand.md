excerpt: Fight off endless enemies, with Shader effects in use.

Player as a hover tank, the last of it's faction, and fight off the endless tide of enemies committed to destroying you with an array of unique and powerful weapons. Hold out for as long as you can!

The goal for making this game was to play around with shaders in Unity via Shader Graph. Learnt some cool things but lost interest making the full game I had in mind, so here is a MVP.
