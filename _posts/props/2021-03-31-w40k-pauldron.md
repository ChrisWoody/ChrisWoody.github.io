Afterwards fit onto the main piece and cut off the excess. I heat gunned this afterwards, however this caused the pieces to shrink slightly. SO in hindsight, should have left them as extra long, heat gunned, THEN trimmed. In this case the gaps were filled with the cut offs, after adding flexbound and spray painting this won't be too visible."

I love Warhammer and I enjoy making things so I've been keen for a while to create something Warhammer-themed using foam. In this case I've created a Pauldron armour piece for a Space Marine, specifically from the Salamanders chapter which is one of my favorites!

<img style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="/assets/images/w40k-pauldron/website-icon.jpg">

## How

When initially looking into this I struggled to find any foam templates for a set of Space Marine armour, but was able to use templates used for paper craft instead. This slightly impacted the final build with some minor gaps but that's just part of the learning process. [Find the templates here](http://obscuruscrusade.com/forum/index.php?topic=1544.0)

## What I learned

* When cutting out the foam I did it straight down, but considering the angles and width of the foam I should have cut them at a bit of an angle so they would join together with a smoother finish.
* The BluTac worked well to hold the stencil in place for the dragon head, but it wasn't perfect and it caused the finer points (for example the teeth) to not be painted as nicely as I would like, so next time if using BluTac again make sure it's a bit flatter and better molded to the edges of the stencil.
* When spray painting I tried to be careful and used masking tape, which mostly worked well but it wasn't stuck perfectly everywhere so caused some colors to get through the gaps. So will just try to stick things properly next time.
