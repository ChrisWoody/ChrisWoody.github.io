After getting a foam prop of Thor's hammer I was keen to get more foam weapons. Though there are a few around I thought it would be more fun to make my own.

I didn't realise how large the prop-making scene was and found many videos and tutorials, but I needed to start somewhere so I found a video on making a foam sword that covered the whole process.

## What I learnt

- That you need a decent cutting knife, and to be steady when trying to cut an angle
- Hot glue on PVC and foam will cause them to melt and flex a bit, so make sure they are held in shape till it cools down
- For the handle use better fake leather, the one I used was too thick
